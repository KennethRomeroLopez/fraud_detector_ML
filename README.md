# Fraud detector Machine Learning project :credit_card:


### In this project several supervised learning Machine Learning models are used to determine whether a card transaction is a fraud or not.
### The models with the best performance were Random Forest and Decision Tree, with f1 metrics higher than 90%.
### In the attached PDF (in Spanish) you will find the description of the data, my analysis, several plots, and conclusions.
### The data used was extracted from Kaggle.

### Thank you for your visit,
